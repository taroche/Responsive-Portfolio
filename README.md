# Responsive-Portfolio


## Overview

This is a responsive portfolio that I made with bootstrap. There are four html files. Three with the main information and one for a navbar that I use for all three of the other pages. One page if for to contact me where it ask for you name, email, a message where you can tell me why you would like to take to me. There is also a submit button. This page does nothing to contact me and is just for looks. The next page is and about me page where I tell aboutmy work history. The last one is a Portfolio page with some stock images beacuse I was not sure what to put here since I don't have that much work in open source or that many pictures of myself.
