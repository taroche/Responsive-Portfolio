            <p>Before I became a developer, I was working at Gelato Fiasco. I started there as just a simple kitchen
              working at one of their stores. I would spend the days making gelato for each customer that walked into
              the door. They then decide to expand their business to make pints to sell in the shores all around America
              and for that they build a factory. When we moved into the new factory, they grabbed a couple of us form
              the kitchen to work there and since I had proven to be one of the harder workers there, I was put in
              charge of one of the two shifts even though I was one of the newer people. While in charge of my shift I
              made sure to always hit the number that they set for that day and to try and go above it whenever
              possible. In fact, I like to treat every day like a competition between us and the other shift so see who
              got more done (and I very rarely lost). The company then bought some new equipment to help produce things
              faster and because my shift was the more productive of the two, I was put in charge of learning the new
              machine and any other that we would get. I spent 2 years overseeing maintenance of all the
              machines under a great factory manager and when she left, I was promoted to her job where I would be in
              charge of everything until they decide to close their factory to switch to a third-party provider of cost
              resounds.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>I then switch to follow my dream to be a web developer. I went down to Maryland to go to a front-end
              development boot camp. Where I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then got my first job in tech for
              Concourse Federal Group as a contract working in quality assurance. Just going over their code checking
              their spelling and grammar (since it were not written by native English speakers). When the contract
              ended, I
              got another job working at Clicknotices doing a lot of code refactoring. They had an old web site that had
              a lot of copy and pasted code that they want to make a lot cleaner and more reusable. They then got bought
              out and the company that did it decided to just scrap the whole project and to use their one development
              team to remake the whole thing. So, they let the development team at Clicknotices go. I then came back to
              Maine and enrolled in the UNH full stack development boot camp to learn to do more things then just front
              end.</p>

            <p>This is a group project that I worked on for my full stack development class at UNH. This was made by me
              and three other people using two different apis. You can use this website to help find brewyers in an area. You
              activac the page by entering any zip code that you would like to check into the search bar and click the
              search button. That then populates the carisoal with a list of all the brewyers in that area. For each
              brewyer the carisoal shows the name of the place, their address, phone, and a link to their website. On
              the right side of the carisoal it shows where the brewyer is on a map. You are also able to click a
              favorite button to add any of the brewyers that you really like to a favorite section to more easily find
              them in the future. Your favorite section saves to the localstorage and will be there when you reload the
              page.</p>
